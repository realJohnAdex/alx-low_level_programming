# Makefile

This Makefile is a simple tool for automating the build process of your project.

## Usage

To use the Makefile, simply run the `make` command followed by the target you want to build.

Example:

## Targets

- `all`: Builds the entire project.
- `clean`: Removes all generated files.
- `help`: Displays available targets and their descriptions.

Feel free to modify the Makefile to suit your project's needs.
